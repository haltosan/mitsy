change to absolute goto:
  with relative, it makes compiling easy
  can't return from functions; goto/push;[EIP] is used to return, but this moved far out of instruction range
  +possible other solutions:
   - edit EIP  :  goto argument is processed after the others
   - have override for EIP to remedy the 1st proposed issue  :  adds unnessisary complexity to the pure mov idea
   - translate absolute EIP to reletive location
     <>someVar=0 goto;[someVar] calculateRelative->someVar goto-1st-goto

get multiplication, modulo, exponents
package a nice alu (with functions for add, sub, etc)


mitsy 2.0
  remove goto, just modify EIP
  compiler optimization (use alu or repeat functions) + research
